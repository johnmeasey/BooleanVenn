# BooleanVenn
This is a shiny app to be imbedded into [How to write a PhD in Biological Sciences: a guide for the uninitiated](https://howtowriteaphd.org/) (and for anyone else who wants to use it). 

The aim is that is teaches readers the logic of what will or won't be included in their Boolean search when they understake it. It is really a simple manifestation of set science.

Here's an idea of what it will look like:

Or you can look at the app on shiny [here](https://johnmeasey.shinyapps.io/shiny_app/)

```{r fig:shinyapp, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
cat('
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
  <iframe src="https://johnmeasey.shinyapps.io/shiny_app/" width="100%" height="800px" style="border:none;"></iframe>
</div>
')
```
